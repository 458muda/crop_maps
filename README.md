#### Crop type mapping for major crops in Ejura and Tain regions in Ghana

This project is related to the ongoing research for Enabling Crop Analytics at Scale which aims to improve and expand crop type mapping. 

1. Imported preprocessed level3 imagery of Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2, PlanetScope basemap imagery for the region
1. Ran iterative random forest model to generate cropland probabilities
2. Polygonized raster probabilities to create polygons for crop type mapping
